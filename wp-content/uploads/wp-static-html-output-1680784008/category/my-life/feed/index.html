										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Learning React was a game-changer for me. Once I discovered the power and flexibility of this JavaScript library, I knew that I would never be able to go back to working with vanilla JavaScript. React has completely transformed the way I approach web development, and has opened up new possibilities and opportunities for me as a developer. In this article, I&#8217;ll share my journey to learning React, including the challenges, breakthroughs, and insights that I gained along the way.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://react.dev/"><img decoding="async" src="https://reactnative.dev/img/logo-og.png" alt="" width="-113" height="-59"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">React official site</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>I started my journey to learning React by enrolling in <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact/first-react-coc0845dcb1a26cb0769a2fea" data-type="URL" data-id="https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact/first-react-coc0845dcb1a26cb0769a2fea">Scrimba&#8217;s 10-hour React course</a>. This course provided a solid foundation for understanding the basics of React, including components, props, state, and lifecycle methods. I also found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified">SuperSimple Dev&#8217;s videos</a> to be incredibly helpful. Their step-by-step tutorials and practical examples helped me apply what I learned in Scrimba&#8217;s course to real-world scenarios. </p>



<p>However, despite the quality of the resources I used, I still encountered some challenges along the way. One of the biggest hurdles I faced was getting the React package installed and configured properly on my machine. This resulted in a lot of frustration and wasted time, and forced me to do some of my early coding exercises on StackBlitz. Additionally, I found the JSX syntax, particularly the use of props, to be quite difficult to acclimate to. It took me some time to understand how to properly pass data between components, and how to structure my code in a way that was both efficient and readable.</p>



<p>Despite the challenges I faced, I continued to persevere in my journey to learn React. In fact, I&#8217;ve already made significant progress with a personal project I&#8217;m working on: a neural network builder app. Using the skills I&#8217;ve learned through Scrimba&#8217;s course and SuperSimple Dev&#8217;s tutorials, I&#8217;ve been able to create a dynamic app that allows users to create and delete nodes in a neural network, as well as turn them on and off. This has been an exciting and rewarding experience, and has really solidified my understanding of React&#8217;s core concepts.</p>



<p>Through my experiences learning React, I&#8217;ve also come to understand the importance of having the right tools for the job. My current laptop, while functional, is not ideal for running resource-intensive development environments, and has slowed me down at times. Additionally, I&#8217;ve realized that proper code organization and structure is crucial for building complex applications with React. Specifically, I need to gain a better understanding of JavaScript modules and how they can be used to modularize my code. Most importantly, I&#8217;ve learned that watching videos alone isn&#8217;t enough to master a new skill. Learning by practice and building actual projects is essential to cementing concepts and building confidence in my abilities.</p>



<p>In conclusion, my journey of learning React has been an enriching and rewarding experience. I have gained a solid understanding of the basics of React and have already begun developing my own neural network builder app using React. Although I encountered some difficulties along the way, such as struggling to install packages and acclimatizing to the JSX props syntax, I persevered and was able to overcome these obstacles. Going forward, I plan to continue developing my skills and building more complex applications with React. Of course, if I find a better library that suits my needs, I may switch to it, but for now, React is the perfect tool for me. I cannot stress enough the importance of learning by practice when it comes to mastering any new skill, and React is no exception. With practice, patience, and persistence, anyone can become a proficient React developer.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">My Journey to Becoming a Web Developer</h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>



<p>My journey to becoming a web developer started in my IT lesson, where I was introduced to coding for the first time. From that moment, I was hooked. My first project was a school canteen website, which looking back, was pretty crappy. But it was my first step into the world of web development, and I was determined to keep learning.</p>



<p>As I continued to code, I built a <a href="https://i.postimg.cc/gknftV2P/Kalkula-kasn-mek.png">calculator</a>, an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://i.postimg.cc/brvKhb0k/Akv-rkosn-mek.png" data-type="URL" data-id="https://i.postimg.cc/brvKhb0k/Akv-rkosn-mek.png" target="_blank">aquarium simulator</a>, <a href="https://codepen.io/Nockiest/pen/VwBoQXb">parlax</a>, a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://i.postimg.cc/ZK2XGWWv/hodinyv-st-i-ek.png" target="_blank">clock</a>, and even<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://codepen.io/Nockiest/pen/zYJaNOb" data-type="URL" data-id="https://codepen.io/Nockiest/pen/zYJaNOb" target="_blank"> a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://i.postimg.cc/g2h1mGhS/achysn-mek.png" target="_blank">chess clone</a>,</a>  These projects helped me hone my skills in programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and react.</p>



<p>Now, I am eager to expand my knowledge in areas like WordPress, marketing, and game engines. I want to be able to build websites that not only look great but also perform well and provide value to users. With WordPress, I can create websites that are easy to manage and update. Marketing will help me promote my skills and services to potential clients. And game engines will enable me to develop engaging and interactive experiences for users.</p>



<p>As I look to the future, I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead. I want to continue learning and growing as a web developer, and I am eager to see where this journey takes me. With the support of the online community and my dedication to improving my skills, I am confident that I can achieve my goals and make a positive impact in the world of web development.</p>
